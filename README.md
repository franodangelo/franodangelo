## 👋 Hi, I'm Franco D'Angelo: a Full Stack Developer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina!

👀 I'm interested in working in technology to help with all my knowledge in development and UX design. I am currently looking for my first job in IT!

🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node, Express & PostgreSQL.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in social impact projects, in which I can really solve people's needs. The projects that interest me the most are those related to products, entertainment and sports.

📫 You can find me on Linkedin, or contact me by phone or email:
